Time Complexity:
Linear Search:O(n)
Linear Search is slower with larger datasets

Binary Search:O(log n)
Binary Search is faster than Linear Search for larger datasets but it needs sorted input.


As E-commerce platforms usually pre-sort or index products, Binary Search is more suitable since the searching will be faster because
Binary Search is faster with larger datasets given the iinput is sorted which in case of E-commerce platforms is already sorted.
