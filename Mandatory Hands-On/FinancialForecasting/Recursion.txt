Recursion is a technique where a method calls itself to break down a problem into smaller subproblems.

Recusrion breaks a problem into modular approach mainly by breaking the solution into base case and recusrion case and calls the recursion case
from within itself until base case is achieved. This reduces the length of code, less variable is used and in most cases reduces complexity of code.
