Time Complexity of the code is O(n) beacuse recusrion is called once per year, i.e, n no. of times.

Optimization methods:
1. by using memoization concept which caches results of function calls to avoid redundant computations(repeated computation 
   of same function).
2. by using tail recusrsion where recursive call is the last operation performed. This reduces the time complexity when recursive calls 
   are large in number.
3. by using accumulators which store value of one recursive computation and passes it to next computation.
