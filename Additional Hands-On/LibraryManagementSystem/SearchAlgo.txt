Linear Search:
In Linear Search, we iterate over all the elements of the array and check if it the current element is equal to the target element. 
If we find any element to be equal to the target element, then return the index of the current element. Otherwise, if no element is
equal to the target element, then return -1 as the element is not found.

Binary Search:
Binary Search Algorithm is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. 
The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N). To apply this
search, the data structure must be sorted and access to any element of the data structure should take constant time.
