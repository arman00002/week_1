Algorithm       Best          Average        Worst    
Bubble Sort	    O(n)	      O(n²)	        O(n²)	  
Quick Sort	    O(n log n)	  O(n log n)	    O(n²)

Quick Sort is preferred because it is much faster on average than Bubble Sort due to divide-and-conquer approach and More scalable 
for large data.
