Singly Linked List:
Each node contains data and a reference to the next node only.Simpler and memory-efficient.Best for forward traversal and 
dynamic insertions/deletions.

Doubly Linked List:
Each node has two pointers: one to the next node, one to the previous.Allows forward and backward traversal.Slightly more memory 
usage, but better for frequent two-way navigation.
