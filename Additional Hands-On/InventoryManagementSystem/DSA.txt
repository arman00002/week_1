Warehouses can store thousands of items, and operations like adding, updating, or searching must be fast.Using appropriate 
data structures ensures efficient performance and scalability.

Suitable Data Structures:
1.ArrayList-Simple inventory and sequential lookup
2.HashMap-Fast lookup by product ID
3.TreeMap-Sorted inventory by key

For this case, HashMap is ideal because each product has a unique productId and we want fast retrieval and updates.
